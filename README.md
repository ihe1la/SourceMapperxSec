Sourcemapper
Sourcemapper is a bit of golang to parse a sourcemap, as generated by webpack or similar, and spit out the original JavaScript files, recreating the source tree based on the file paths in the sourcemap.

An article explaining its purpose is available here: https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps

git clone https://github.com/denandz/sourcemapper
cd sourcemapper
go get
go build

This installs sourcemapper to /go/bin/sourcemapper.
Add it to your PATH by :

export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


Usage : 
Run the below command :
./manitor_js_map.sh
